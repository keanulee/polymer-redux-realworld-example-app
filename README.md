# polymer-redux-realworld-example-app

An WIP implementation of [RealWorld example app](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) with Polymer and Redux. Based on [polymer-redux-hn](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/polymer-redux-hn) and uses [pwa-helpers](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/pwa-helpers).

## Setup

* `npm i`
* Serve index.html for all routes (`serve -s .` or similar)

## Building

Check out the [webpack branch](https://github.com/keanulee/polymer-redux-realworld-example-app/tree/webpack) to see how to use webpack for bundling and module loading. Note that Custom Element and Shadow DOM polyfills aren't included (yet), so the build won't work on unsupported browsers.

## TODO

Unimplemented features are marked with `TODO` in the code, some of which will generate a console warning when used. PRs welcome ;)
